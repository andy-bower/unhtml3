SYNOPSIS

unhtml


-help

unhtml


-version

unhtml


[-comment

]

[-cdata text | comment



]

[FILENAME.html

]

 
DESCRIPTION

The
unhtml


utility remove HTML markup from a document and outputs plain text on stdout in
the UTF-8 charset. The input needs to be UTF-8; if the input uses another
character set then this should be transformed first.


unhtml


is an extractor not a renderer; other tools are more appropriate if the output
is to be embellished with rendering based on HTML markup.


Content within the
`<SCRIPT>'

and
`<STYLE>'

elements is ignored.
 
Options

The options are as follows:



-version



Show the version information.
-help



Show usage and other help.
-comment



Include comments in the output.
-cdata=comment



Treat CDATA sections as comments. The default is to treat CDATA sections
simply as text that is immune from being interpreted as special HTML
sequences.



 
EXAMPLES

Convert
`index.html'

to text on stdout.

unhtml index.html


Convert HTML on stdin into text on stdout.

unhtml < index.html

HISTORY

unhtml


version 3 is a complete rewrite that is backwards-compatible with
unhtml


version 2.3.9
Po originally known as

clean

Pc written by Kevin Swan in 1998.



The new version uses
Lb libgumbo

to parse the HTML before extracting the text to ensure accurate handling of
doctypes, comments, CDATA sections and HTML 5 tag soup and to upgrade from
only handling ISO-8859-1 to using UTF-8 throughout.

BUGS

unhtml


only outputs UTF-8 and does not convert its output to the character set of
the current locale.


unhtml


ignores any character set defined within a
`<META>'

element or XML header and treats the input as UTF-8 regardless.
